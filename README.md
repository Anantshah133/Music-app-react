# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Music App Project

## How to Start the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the project, make sure to install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start JSON Server**: Open a new terminal and start the JSON server using the following command. This will mock your backend and provide the necessary data for your music app.

    ```bash
    json-server db.json --port=4000
    ```

3. **Start Vite Server**: Open another terminal and start the Vite server to run your React app. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
